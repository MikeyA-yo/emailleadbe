No mom, child, or baby dies of a preventable cause. ​\n2. The next generation grows up in a world without deadly infectious diseases. ​\n3. Hundreds of millions of people break free from poverty, putting more countries on a path to prosperity. ​\n ​\nI know that with the right commitment of resources, a fairer and healthier future for everyone is just on the horizon.\nWhat the Gates Foundation hopes to accomplish over the next 20 years\nBill Gates on LinkedIn • 5 min read\n4,961\n972 comments\nPost\nPost\nI have always been an optimist. These days, though, my optimism comes with footnotes. For the first time this century, the world slipped backwards on key measures like childhood mortality in 2025, and if we don’t make the right decisions, this trend will continue.  At the same time, I also believe that, within the next decade, the world will not only get back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress. As we start 2026, I’m thinking about how the year ahead will position us for decades to come. \nHow to get the world back on track and enter a new era of unprecedented progress\nBill Gates on LinkedIn • 5+ min read\n5,857\n959 comments\nActivity\nActivity\n39,962,208 followers\n39,962,208 followers\nFollow\nPosts\nComments\nVideos\nImages\nNewsletter\nDocuments\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nBill Gates\nBill Gates\n • 3rd+\nInfluencer • 3rd+\nChair, Gates Foundation and Founder, Breakthrough Energy\nChair, Gates Foundation and Founder, Breakthrough Energy\nView my newsletter\n3w • \n3 weeks ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nThis anti-malarial drug is poised to become the first breakthrough in malaria treatment in almost 25 years. This incredible step forward is a testament to partnership and science—and it couldn’t have come at a more critical time. ​\n…more\nGates Foundation\nGates Foundation\n1,481,400 followers\n1,481,400 followers\nScience has brought us one step closer to a world without malaria.\nGanLum is the first breakthrough in malaria treatment in more than 25 years, offering hope for families across Africa.

All the value goes straight to shareholders.\nAnother thing I feel super proud about is that Microsoft is now behind two of the largest nonprofits in the world!\nYou can read more about our results here: https://lnkd.in/gxtVeMk2 \n7,825\n443 comments\nPost\nPost\nI love how easy it’s becoming to learn on the go with podcasts in Copilot.\nI turned GitHub’s latest Octoverse report into a 5-minute pod — short, smart, and snappy.

The twisting path from an early innovation to transformational societal impact was laid bare. As such, Cambridge Enterprise has a diverse toolkit to support founders who are tackling global challenges. The energy in the room was electrifying and carried me throughout the rest of the week.\nAt the SPARK 1.0 Demo Day, a programme created by @Kings E-Lab in partnership with @Founders at the University of Cambridge, I was fortunate to witness 22 ventures from across 17 University departments pitch bold ideas, from climate tech to digital health, to a room full of investors, advisors and peers. The drive, collaboration and ambition on display captured the spirit of Cambridge perfectly.\nMeanwhile, @BioCentury Inc. Grand Rounds brought leading life science investors, academics and biopharma leaders to the city and @Cambridge Tech Week showcased the visionaries and specialists behind Cambridge’s thriving tech ecosystem.\nThis is a truly special ecosystem, with an exceptional degree of connection and support amongst all stakeholders, and one that I am proud to be a part of.\nhashtag\n#Cambridge \nhashtag\n#Innovation \nhashtag\n#CamTechWeek \nhashtag\n#Startups \nhashtag\n#Networking\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n181\n11 comments\n2 reposts\nJim Glasheen reposted this\nCambridge Tech Podcast\nCambridge Tech Podcast\n3,449 followers\n3,449 followers\n7mo • \n7 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nWhat happens when a San Francisco VC takes the reins at Cambridge Enterprise?\nSix months into the role, Jim Glasheen joins us to talk about his early moves as incoming CEO, like opening a London office to better plug Cambridge into global capital and talent flows. But this episode goes deeper than strategy.\n🔑 Key takeaways:\n• Cambridge has over 40 entrepreneurship programmes, but Jim questions if we’re at risk of creating an “illusion of entrepreneurship” without real market pressure.\n• There’s a persistent Series B funding gap. His push? Build international investor relationships before companies need to scale.\n• He wants the ecosystem to get more comfortable with failure and take on more risk. \n• Cambridge Enterprise now spans licensing, founder support, venture investment, consulting, and ecosystem-building.\nJim’s set the clock ticking: in 6 months, he’ll report back on how international outreach and risk appetite are shifting. For now, he's off to the BIO conference in Boston to keep building those global ties.\n🎧 Listen in for a sharp, honest look at what Cambridge needs next, and how leadership is setting the tone.\nTune in on your chosen podcast platform to subscribe and listen.\nApple podcast: https://apple.co/3P9RegV\nSpotify: https://lnkd.in/enP_4QVr\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/3VHqGGs\nYouTube: https://lnkd.in/eAg5Wv42\nhashtag\n#CamTechPod\nIn this week’s news: MatNex, KPMG, HutanBio, HotHouse Therapeutics, Monumo, Shujiro Imamura, SCI Ventures, Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, Healx, Pragmatic Semiconductor, John Quigley, David Moore\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n188\n8 comments\n14 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nChief Executive Officer\nChief Executive Officer\nCambridge Enterprise · Full-time\nCambridge Enterprise · Full-time\nNov 2024 - Present · 1 yr 4 mos\nNov 2024 to Present · 1 yr 4 mos\nCambridge, England, United Kingdom\nCambridge, England, United Kingdom\nPresident / Co-founder / Board Member\nPresident / Co-founder / Board Member\nClade Therapeutics · Full-time\nClade Therapeutics · Full-time\n2021 - Dec 2024 · 4 yrs\n2021 to Dec 2024 · 4 yrs\nCambridge, Massachusetts, United States\nCambridge, Massachusetts, United States\nCo-Founder / President / CEO (2018-2019)/ board member (2018-2020)\nCo-Founder / President / CEO (2018-2019)/ board member (2018-2020)\nAtalanta Therapeutics\nAtalanta Therapeutics\n2018 - 2020 · 2 yrs\n2018 to 2020 · 2 yrs\nBoston, Massachusetts, United States\nBoston, Massachusetts, United States\nExecutive Vice Chancellor\nExecutive Vice Chancellor\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School\nUniv",

This latest hike will wrap up the most aggressive year of monetary policy in four decades. We know it has caused weariness and uncertainty across financial markets, and many are now casting their eyes forward to what 2023 might have in store. \nOn a more positive note, yesterday’s CPI data suggest that the inflation fever might be starting to break, which could translate into smaller interest rate increments over the next year. Financial markets had priced in a peak of 6% for the base rate at one point, but signs suggest it might not reach these heights. Nevertheless, as the UK enters into recession, agility, diversification and foresight will be key in injecting resilience into investment portfolios and minimising investors' exposure to the current macroeconomic headwinds. \nWith investors juggling risk and opportunity, it should be expected that many will look to balance traditional and alternative investments. Moreover, in light of the recent Autumn Statement, it is likely that tax-efficient investments will see greater demand. I would also expect real estate to remain high on investors’ wish lists, even as house prices recalibrate, with the latest stamp duty cuts likely to increase the market’s resilience in the face of the wider economic turbulence.\nhashtag\n#boe \nhashtag\n#mpc \nhashtag\n#interestrate \nhashtag\n#uk \nhashtag\n#inflation \n26\n2 comments\nPost\nPost\nWe were absolutely delighted to be shortlisted in three categories and receive the Innovative Lender of the Year award at the recent Alternative Credit Investor Awards! \nThank you Suzie Neuwirth for the great hospitality and cong",

Joshua now helps out with PT sessions for children and teens to encourage them back to fitness after treatment.\nThe charity is currently supporting more than 300 families from the local area but the demand for the service they offer is increasing nationwide as families travel further to access treatment from nearby Alder Hey and Manchester Children’s Hospital.\nDIY SOS & Children in Need invites all trades, volunteers and suppliers to help support our build for this amazing charity, so they can expand and continue the life changing work they already do.\n…more\n14\n1 comment\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nRestful homes group\nRestful homes group\nRestful homes group\nFull-time · 14 yrs 6 mos\nFull-time · 14 yrs 6 mos\nChief Executive Officer\nChief Executive Officer\nSep 2011 - Present · 14 yrs 6 mos\nSep 2011 to Present · 14 yrs 6 mos\nWest Midlands, England, United Kingdom · On-site\nWest Midlands, England, United Kingdom · On-site\nDirector Of Operations\nDirector Of Operations\nDec 2016 - Sep 2024 · 7 yrs 10 mos\nDec 2016 to Sep 2024 · 7 yrs 10 mos\nBirmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom\nBirmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom\nRESTFUL HOMES GROUP LTD. logo\nManager\nManager\nRESTFUL HOMES GROUP LTD.\nRESTFUL HOMES GROUP LTD.\nAug 2011 - Jul 2016 · 5 yrs\nAug 2011 to Jul 2016 · 5 yrs\nHeath Hayes, Staffordshire, United Kingdom\nHeath Hayes, Staffordshire, United Kingdom\nI manage a 73 bedded specialist challenging behaviour unit, for residents with all types of dementia illnesses, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, personality disorder & behavioural problems.

Our new Specially Selected Ultimate range is just one example of the team's dedication to providing the very best in quality this year.\nOur Marketing Team have also outdone themselves with a fantastic campaign that I know will resonate with our customers—and yes, it does see the return of everyone's favourite carrot!\nOn top of that, we’ve been recognised as the Best Overall Grocer in Good Housekeeping's Christmas Taste Test 2024. This accolade is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our excellent Buying team. From our famous Mince Pies to centrepiece Turkeys - each and every detail of our award-winning products has been meticulously crafted to deliver excellence.\nLastly, a huge thank you to our store and warehouse teams, who are prepped and ready to welcome thousands of shoppers this festive season. Your dedication ensures we’ll deliver an Aldi Amazing Christmas once again.\nThis is one of my favourite times of year, and I’m incredibly impressed by everything we’ve achieved together at Aldi.\nhashtag\n#AldiAmazingChristmas \nhashtag\n#KevinTheCarrot \nhashtag\n#Christmas2024\n914\n26 comments\nPost\nPost\nOn Monday night, BBC Panorama aired an investigation that revealed some eye-opening findings about supermarket price-matching. They found that many of Tesco’s products, which claim to be price-matched with Aldi, are not like-for-like. \nThe programme, which aired on BBC One, highlighted that nearly a third of Tesco’s matched products contain less of the main ingredient compared to Aldi’s. This really reinforces what we’ve always believed: Aldi is the only supermarket where you can count on both top-quality products and low prices.\nAt Aldi, we believe that fresh, healthy, great-quality food is a right, not a privilege. That’s why we’re so committed to bringing our customers the best at the most affordable prices. And while we put all our energy into maintaining these standards, we’re aware that no one is perfect, including ourselves. We are always striving to improve, and we welcome feedback from our valued customers to help us do just that.\nWe’re aware that other retailers might claim to match our prices, but as this research shows, these claims are not always what they appear to be. We welcome the investigation by Panorama, as it supports what we passionately believe: at Aldi, you don’t have to compromise on quality to get great value.\nWe work tirelessly to ensure our exclusive products are not only affordable but meet the highest standards, often with a higher specification than equivalent own-label products sold by our competitors. This dedication has been recognised, with Aldi winning over 530 individual awards for quality over the last 12 months, including Quality Food Aw",

This is currently highlighted by an online article of Renew Economy from autor Sophie Vorrath about a new project in the South Burnett region of Queensland that focuses on precisely these requirements. \nThe key message of the article is: \nthe advantages of PEG® are obvious!\n·      PEG® does not require concrete - no heavy foundations\n·      PEG® reduces material and logistics costs\n·      PEG® enables quick installation - with standard hand tools. \n·      PEG® stands for high land utilization and low visual impact. \n·      PEG® optimizes the cost-effectiveness of projects. (Fewer machines, less logistics, less steel, and shorter construction phases mean lower overall costs and reduced risks).\nProjects such as the one in Queensland highlight the importance of substructures - like the highly efficient PEG® solar mounting system - for the energy transition in terms of sustainability, approvability, and cost-effectiveness.\nCheck out the full RENEW ECONOMY article.

It gives us access to experience across markets, the ability to collaborate across disciplines and the confidence to invest in growth. Sitting with the leadership team this week, mapping out the years ahead, it’s clear that we have such a unique proposition.\nIt’s been an exciting few days.\nAnd if you want to be part of a business with genuine growth plans, where you can build something meaningful without doing it alone, I’m always open to a confidential conversation.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/3\nActivate to view larger image,\n138\n5 comments\n4 reposts\nOliver Nevel\nOliver Nevel\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nCEO - W Executive\nCEO - W Executive\n1mo • \n1 month ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nAnother reminder of why proximity matters so much in leadership.\nStaying close enough to support our team, clients we work with and the markets we operate in makes it easier to lead with clarity rather than assumption.\nSince the start of the year, I’ve spent time across different parts of the UK, followed by a week in NYC meeting clients and building our network as we continue to grow both the W Executive and W Talent businesses.\nFor a business like ours, you can’t lead effectively when you’re stuck behind a desk.\n If you’re only focused on the internal mechanics, you miss too much of what’s happening outside the business. January so far has been about listening to clients to understand their 2026 priorities. And I’ve been doing that alongside our brilliant teams in both businesses.\nThose conversations and the miles that come with them, have also reinforced the value of the wider W-Group for our clients.\nThat scale matters, but only when it’s informed by proximity. Being close to markets allows us to think and deliver internationally.\nAs a CEO, that’s the balance I care most about. Staying close enough to reality to make better decisions, while building a platform that helps our clients do the same.\nIt’s been a strong start. And I’m already looking forward to what comes next.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n68\n1 comment\n1 repost\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nCEO\nCEO\nW Executive · Full-time\nW Executive · Full-time\nAug 2023 - Present · 2 yrs 7 mos\nAug 2023 to Present · 2 yrs 7 mos\nGreater London, England, United Kingdom\nGreater London, England, United Kingdom\nAs the Founder and CEO of W Executive and W Talent UK, I lead a team of exceptional professionals dedicated to establishing an innovative and ambitious challenger brand in Executive Search.\nWith the robust financial support of W Group, one of Europe's rapidly expanding executive recruitment brands, we are shaping a truly collaborative talent organisation.

Fast forward 28 years, and we've grown into a truly global organisation of 8,600 talented individuals, spanning 37 dynamic markets. \nAs I look back on our remarkable journey, I am immensely proud of everything our incredible team has achieved. It's testament to our unwavering commitment to the success of our clients, candidates and employees. \nLast week, the Executive Board and I unveiled PageGroup's new strategy that will guide us through to 2030. This strategy builds upon our existing strengths and focuses on what we’re famous for. \nOur path forward will be defined by a set of strategic goals designed to unlock our full potential and amplify our impact. These are based around delivering an ambitious operating profit, driving social impact by changing one million lives, and offering best-in-class customer experience. \nOur approach centres around maximising our core business and building on our market-leading position. Additionally, we'll leverage our existing global platforms and harness the \nhashtag\n#PowerofPage, expanding our technology recruitment business, growing Page Executive, and nurturing strategic partnerships, seizing opportunities that will allow us to stand out in specific areas and markets. \nEnabling our success, we will draw on the global technology and insights platforms now in place and used every day by our teams worldwide. Our investments in these areas mean we are well positioned to leverage opportunities globally across our business in innovation, especially when it comes to AI. \nI am looking forward to this exciting new chapter in PageGroup's history and leading a business that is customer led, people powered, and insights driven. \nThank you to our incredible team and partners for being part of this journey.

Passionate about building teams that have plenty of fun and success.\nFeatured\nFeatured\nPost\nPost\nI’m thrilled to share some exciting news that marks a major milestone for us at Virgin Media O2. \nWe’re combining Virgin Media O2 Business with Daisy Group to create a new B2B powerhouse in the UK business communications and IT sector. \nThis perfect pairing will see us establish a dedicated, focused, and digital-first B2B business serving hundreds of thousands of customers across small, medium and large enterprises, as well as the public sector, all underpinned by our next generation fixed and mobile infrastructure. The new entity will be led by a talented team, with Daisy founder, Matthew Riley, as Chair and Jo Bertram as CEO, ensuring we hit the ground running from day one. \nFor us, it’s a big step forward in our journey to boost B2B growth and provide UK businesses of all sizes with the best digital and connectivity offerings. \nWe’re incredibly proud of this moment, and a big thank you to all of the people who have worked tirelessly to make this happen — I can’t wait to get started on this next chapter in our B2B story. \nHead to our News page for full details ➡️ https://vmo2.co/VMO2Daisy \n1,180\n34 comments\nPost\nPost\nToday we’re announcing our Q4 and full year 2024 financial results as Virgin Media O2. \nWe said 2024 was a year of investing to support our long-term growth and these results reflect that. We close the first chapter of Virgin Media O2 having delivered our full year guidance and hitting our JV synergy targets 18 months ahead of schedule, meaning we are well set for the future.\nWe ended the year with another quarter of fixed customer and ARPU growth, positive mobile contract additions and improved customer satisfaction through a relentless focus on customer experience.\nOur investments of more than £2 billion across the year helped us to significantly boost our \nhashtag\n#5G coverage, improve mobile network quality and enhance rural connectivity. We also expanded our fibre footprint faster than ever as we build on our existing gigabit leadership and push ahead with creating the biggest fibre challenger in the UK along with nexfibre.\nIn 2024 we laid the foundations for future success, and in 2025 we will get back to growth in core revenues and profitability while continuing investment in our networks and services. Throughout the year we’ll also deliver on key strategic moves, including the creation of a fixed NetCo and the expected acquisition of spectrum from Vodafone-Three which will further improve mobile performance. This is the start of a new chapter for Virgin Media O2. \nOur Earnings Release here ➡️ https://lnkd.in/eMmSAqNK\nhashtag\n#VirginMediaO2Results \nhashtag\n#TeamVirginMediaO2 \n372\n10 comments\nPost\nPost\nTwo brand new campaigns in one day! \nOur O2 Switch Up and Virgin Media broadband campaigns have launched today, showcasing the fantastic offering from the Virgin Media O2 brands. \nI’m also thrilled Virgin Media broadband has recently been awarded ‘Best Broadband Experience’ by Global Wireless Solutions, Inc. – the network benchmarking specialist. \nFantastic work from the whole \nhashtag\n#VirginMediaO2 family. \n📱 Only O2 Switch up: https://vmo2.co/3WVqcys\n🌐 Walrus Whizzer: https://lnkd.in/e4ZC3egS \nhashtag\n#TeamVirginMediaO2 \nhashtag\n#O2 \nhashtag\n#VirginMedia \nhashtag\n#Mobile \nhashtag\n#Broadband \nhashtag\n#SwitchUp \nhashtag\n#Bubl \nhashtag\n#Walrus \nhashtag\n#Smoooooth Virgin Media O2\n134\n11 comments\nPost\nPost\nToday we share our Q1 2023 results as Virgin Media O2. \nI’m pleased that we delivered a solid performance as we laid the groundwork for further progress through the remainder of the year. \nAs the leading gigabit network in the country, we continue to maintain our position in speed leadership, providing customers with broadband that is five times faster than the UK average. Our ongoing investment in upgrading and expanding our footprint has us on track to cover 80% of the country with full fibre.

My phone is de@d and I need to call someone urgently, and you, being a nice person, say no problem, take and make the call.\nDo you know what you have done? If your phone is used to call someone they want to go and k¡ll or someone they just poisoned and when investigation starts and they have to check who called them last and your number shows up….\nLet me break down what will happen to you so that you will learn something today from this.\nFirst of all, you will be arrested for whatever cr|me because your phone was used to make that call and it will be considered that you know the person that’s why you gave the person your phone and it’s a known deal between both of you.\nSecondly, since the inception of Mobile Networks, your phone is your personal property that you will answer for anything that happens on it or through it.\nSo, for these reasons, you will be arrested and kept in detention until all investigations are\ncompleted. Even if the investigation takes 6 months or 2 years, that means you will be locked up for that period of time over the fact that you just lent someone your phone to make a one minute call.\nDo you now see that your good heart that is void of carefulness can lead you to something so b@d? *And ignorance of the law is not an excuse before the law.\nDon’t be stingy with this information.

That’s more exciting than daunting in my opinion.\nI’ve shared some more thoughts you can read here: \nhttps://lnkd.in/edfaigbF\n…more\nSmarter, faster, but not wiser – yet: The limits of AI in recruitment - H&P Executive Search\nhpexec.com\n28\n9 comments\n1 repost\nHarry Elkington\nHarry Elkington\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nChief Operating Officer at H&P Executive Search\nChief Operating Officer at H&P Executive Search\n1mo • \n1 month ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nJust wanted to shout out Zac Turner for his unreal start at the business. I think its safe to say, changing market specificity after 10 years in industry would be daunting for anyone. But one thing that is essential in getting up and running in a new vertical is perseverance. \nI am sure Zac wouldn't mind me saying that there were a lot of long nights and set backs, especially in first 3 months, to get him to where he is now. Going from a business leader to a learner of a new market is a difficult thing for some people to comprehend. This requires a few things, but most importantly, leaving the ego at the door. I think anyone who has met Zac inside the business will say his humility so far has been admirable. \nOne thing we have now got an excellent track record of across the business is recruiting from other markets and integrating them into high performing teams internally. We are currently hiring across a few business units internally both in London and Miami, and as ever, we are considering people to change market. \nIf you would be interested in hearing about what a market change could look like for you, please reach out.\n…more\nH&P Executive Search\nH&P Executive Search\n78,549 followers\n78,549 followers\nA great milestone for Zac Turner, who closed his first placements at H&P this week – $175,000 and $125,000 on the same day.\nZac joined us only a few months ago as an experienced hire and made a market transition on arrival. Delivering two placements in one day, including the largest of his career to date, reflects both his experience and execution.\nThis is exactly what H&P is about – creating an environment that helps people unlock a new level in their career, whether they are early on or already well established.\nHuge congratulations, Zac.

Follow only\n1mo • Edited • \n1 month ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nA sense of balance is important in business - I know we’ve achieved a lot with Octopus Energy and Kraken - and I’m intensely proud of that - but I also know we’re far from perfect.\nIf I post about customer service - inevitably (and totally rightly) some customers will post comments about where we’ve gone wrong. If I post about tech, people will rightly highlight weaknesses.\nAnd internally, I caution the team about getting high on their own supply - we should be proud and confident but humble about where others are better - not just because there’s a fine line between pride and arrogance, but otherwise how do we learn, improve and grow?\nWhen we get compliments I’m usually quick to mention our shortcomings, and I won’t allow us to be described as “successful” (as Kenny Rogers put it - \"never count your money when you're sitting at the table\").\nSo I rarely feel unalloyed joy. Indeed, there’ve been three moments of uncaveated pride in the history of our company.\nOne was when we first became a unicorn, and could deliver on the promise to our team - all of whom are shareholders, and many took a risk on a startup with big ambitions (a lot of mums and dads quizzed them why they were joining an unknown company with a dozen people in a small office in Hammersmith. This justified their faith). I was equally proud when Al Gore’s fund invested - and we introduced him to the entire company on Zoom - the emoji reactions told me that the team felt the way I did.\nAnd last week - among some of the most impressive businesses in the UK, Octopus was named Britain’s Most Admired Company (https://lnkd.in/etAr-d_y).\nNo caveats (“most admired young company” or “most admired tech company” or whatever) simply “most admired company”.\nI stood there next to the Most Admired Leader (Tufan Erginbilgiç) at the London Stock Exchange and really felt this was a coming of age for our business.\nIt capped a remarkable few weeks. We’d announced the demerger of Kraken - we’d built it from nothing and now it’s a fantastic $9bn monster - freed to meet its full potential (I’ll write about that soon!) And we’d learned that we’d been awarded Which? Recommended for the 9th year in a row. Which? Is just about the most stringent award you can win - and to do so 9 years in a row is huge external recognition for the work our team do for customers.\nSo - we’re not perfect - but I did take a deep breath (it was a breathtaking moment) - and decide it was ok to enjoy a moment of pride. Before setting off back to the office with a renewed sense or purpose, and huge pride in what our team have built. But I’m not gonna lie - it felt good. And I think that’s ok, just occasionally.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/4\nActivate to view larger image,\n2,305\n90 comments\n91 reposts\nGreg Jackson\nGreg Jackson\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nFounder and CEO, Octopus Energy. *Due to volume of spam LinkedIn is not a good place to reach me* Reached 30k Connections.

A balanced diet was not just essential for energy, but also for mental clarity and emotional stability. Wrapped in a towel and feeling refreshed, she reflected on her meals for the next day. “I can’t let convenience compromise my health,” she resolved.\nThe next morning, Maritime awoke with a sense of purpose. She rushed to the kitchen with a plan in mind. She decided to whip up a nutritious breakfast scrambling eggs packed with protein alongside whole grain toast and fresh fruit. Each bite was a reminder that she could nourish her body, setting a positive tone for her day.\nAs she prepared to head to work, she made a mental note to prep a colorful salad for lunch. Filled with leafy greens, healthy fats, and lean protein, it was a delicious way to fuel herself for the tasks that lay ahead. She recognized that taking a bit of extra time to prepare healthy meals was not a burden but an investment in her well-being.\nMaritime embraced this commitment to herself. She understood that nourishing her body would bolster her mental resilience against stress, allowing her to tackle challenges with renewed vigor. With every healthy choice, she felt a growing empowerment.\nClimbing into bed that night, Maritime was filled with a profound sense of accomplishment. She was learning the significance of self-care, healthy eating, and rest. Each new day was an opportunity-an opportunity not just to survive, but to truly thrive. As she drifted off to sleep, she felt optimistic about the journey ahead, ready to face whatever challenges came her way with vitality and strength.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nSee content credentials\nActivate to view larger image,\n2\n1 repost\nAnthony Eghiyo- Esere\nAnthony Eghiyo- Esere\n   • 2nd\nVerified • 2nd\nFounder/GCEO POWERDOT Group, CEO Serotny Global\nFounder/GCEO POWERDOT Group, CEO Serotny Global\n7mo • \n7 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nApart from architectural issues, not conducting soil test and following building guidelines and specifications, majority of building collapse cases in Nigeria is as a result of total negligence. ohh yes we completely ignore the signs at early stage and overtime hairline micro cracks graduates to hairline macro cracks which eventually gives full access to water intrusion amongst structural members and overtime corrosion takes place within the reinforcement embedded inside the sub",

This year’s report explores how AI is reshaping industries, trust, and human-AI collaboration and highlights four main trends: \n1. The Binary Big Bang: When AI expands exponentially, systems are upended; \n2. Your Face, in the Future: Differentiating when every interface looks the same; \n3. When LLMs Get Their Bodies: How foundation models reinvent robotics; and, \n4. The New Learning Loop: How people and AI are defining a virtuous cycle of learning, leading and creating.\nWhat's clear is that the future belongs to leaders who responsibly harness AI’s potential while building trust across all those users involved and affected. Trust isn’t optional – it’s the foundation for transformation in this new era.\nhashtag\n#TechVision2025\nhttps://lnkd.in/eYUwYa7y\nTechnology Trends 2025 | Tech Vision\naccenture.com\n177\n3 comments\nActivity\nActivity\n28,120 followers\n28,120 followers\nFollow\nPosts\nComments\nVideos\nImages\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nShaheen Sayed\nShaheen Sayed\n   • 3rd+\nVerified • 3rd+\nChief Commercial Officer at Accenture\nChief Com",

Framework fatigue is real, and it’s often the biggest barrier to actual progress.\nThe truth is, most organisations already have the data and the tools they need. What’s missing isn’t more structure: it’s the capacity to make sense of it all.\nAt Greenheart, we don’t believe in adding complexity for the sake of it. Our role isn’t to hand you a new manual; it’s to help you join the dots between the ones you already have.\nWhen we partner with leadership teams, we focus on integration over accumulation. We look at how your B Corp commitments, your climate transition plans and your strategic goals can stop competing for attention and start working as one single, resilient operating system.\nThat’s when the magic happens.\nWe love nothing more than giving you the clarity to do less, but better. We aim to give you the confidence to evolve from ‘managing’ sustainability reports to actually running a high-performing, resilient and future-proof business.\nWe’re here to reduce the load, not add to it. Because a strategy that lives in a binder is just a waste of everyone’s time. Whereas a plan that lives in your day-to-day decision-making? That’s resilience.\nWhat acronyms or reporting standards would you ban right now??\nhashtag\n#Greenheart\nhashtag\n#TrustedPartner\nhashtag\n#LeadershipInPractice\n*****\n💚 We’re Greenheart. We partner with organisations to build resilient, future-fit businesses – embedding sustainability into strategy, governance and day-to-day decision-making.\n🔔 Follow us for grounded thinking on leadership, impact and building businesses that hold up under pressure.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n6\n1 repost\nChris Norman MBE reposted this\nCastle Forum\nCastle Forum\n123 followers\n123 followers\n3w • Edited • \n3 weeks ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nCastle Forum X Octopus Energy - The Future of Business - March 25th in London\nBIG ANNOUNCEMENT! 💥 📣 \nWe are excited to invite you all to our first event of 2026 - hosted by Octopus Energy in central London on March 25th (doors at 5:30pm).\nThe topic is a fun one - The Future of Business. \nHow can business be a force for good in a world in crisis?
