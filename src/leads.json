No mom, child, or baby dies of a preventable cause. ​\n2. The next generation grows up in a world without deadly infectious diseases. ​\n3. Hundreds of millions of people break free from poverty, putting more countries on a path to prosperity. ​\n ​\nI know that with the right commitment of resources, a fairer and healthier future for everyone is just on the horizon.\nWhat the Gates Foundation hopes to accomplish over the next 20 years\nBill Gates on LinkedIn • 5 min read\n4,961\n972 comments\nPost\nPost\nI have always been an optimist. These days, though, my optimism comes with footnotes. For the first time this century, the world slipped backwards on key measures like childhood mortality in 2025, and if we don’t make the right decisions, this trend will continue.  At the same time, I also believe that, within the next decade, the world will not only get back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress. As we start 2026, I’m thinking about how the year ahead will position us for decades to come. \nHow to get the world back on track and enter a new era of unprecedented progress\nBill Gates on LinkedIn • 5+ min read\n5,857\n959 comments\nActivity\nActivity\n39,962,208 followers\n39,962,208 followers\nFollow\nPosts\nComments\nVideos\nImages\nNewsletter\nDocuments\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nBill Gates\nBill Gates\n • 3rd+\nInfluencer • 3rd+\nChair, Gates Foundation and Founder, Breakthrough Energy\nChair, Gates Foundation and Founder, Breakthrough Energy\nView my newsletter\n3w • \n3 weeks ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nThis anti-malarial drug is poised to become the first breakthrough in malaria treatment in almost 25 years. This incredible step forward is a testament to partnership and science—and it couldn’t have come at a more critical time. ​\n…more\nGates Foundation\nGates Foundation\n1,481,400 followers\n1,481,400 followers\nScience has brought us one step closer to a world without malaria.\nGanLum is the first breakthrough in malaria treatment in more than 25 years, offering hope for families across Africa.

All the value goes straight to shareholders.\nAnother thing I feel super proud about is that Microsoft is now behind two of the largest nonprofits in the world!\nYou can read more about our results here: https://lnkd.in/gxtVeMk2 \n7,825\n443 comments\nPost\nPost\nI love how easy it’s becoming to learn on the go with podcasts in Copilot.\nI turned GitHub’s latest Octoverse report into a 5-minute pod — short, smart, and snappy.

The twisting path from an early innovation to transformational societal impact was laid bare. As such, Cambridge Enterprise has a diverse toolkit to support founders who are tackling global challenges. The energy in the room was electrifying and carried me throughout the rest of the week.\nAt the SPARK 1.0 Demo Day, a programme created by @Kings E-Lab in partnership with @Founders at the University of Cambridge, I was fortunate to witness 22 ventures from across 17 University departments pitch bold ideas, from climate tech to digital health, to a room full of investors, advisors and peers. The drive, collaboration and ambition on display captured the spirit of Cambridge perfectly.\nMeanwhile, @BioCentury Inc. Grand Rounds brought leading life science investors, academics and biopharma leaders to the city and @Cambridge Tech Week showcased the visionaries and specialists behind Cambridge’s thriving tech ecosystem.\nThis is a truly special ecosystem, with an exceptional degree of connection and support amongst all stakeholders, and one that I am proud to be a part of.\nhashtag\n#Cambridge \nhashtag\n#Innovation \nhashtag\n#CamTechWeek \nhashtag\n#Startups \nhashtag\n#Networking\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n181\n11 comments\n2 reposts\nJim Glasheen reposted this\nCambridge Tech Podcast\nCambridge Tech Podcast\n3,449 followers\n3,449 followers\n7mo • \n7 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nWhat happens when a San Francisco VC takes the reins at Cambridge Enterprise?\nSix months into the role, Jim Glasheen joins us to talk about his early moves as incoming CEO, like opening a London office to better plug Cambridge into global capital and talent flows. But this episode goes deeper than strategy.\n🔑 Key takeaways:\n• Cambridge has over 40 entrepreneurship programmes, but Jim questions if we’re at risk of creating an “illusion of entrepreneurship” without real market pressure.\n• There’s a persistent Series B funding gap. His push? Build international investor relationships before companies need to scale.\n• He wants the ecosystem to get more comfortable with failure and take on more risk. \n• Cambridge Enterprise now spans licensing, founder support, venture investment, consulting, and ecosystem-building.\nJim’s set the clock ticking: in 6 months, he’ll report back on how international outreach and risk appetite are shifting. For now, he's off to the BIO conference in Boston to keep building those global ties.\n🎧 Listen in for a sharp, honest look at what Cambridge needs next, and how leadership is setting the tone.\nTune in on your chosen podcast platform to subscribe and listen.\nApple podcast: https://apple.co/3P9RegV\nSpotify: https://lnkd.in/enP_4QVr\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/3VHqGGs\nYouTube: https://lnkd.in/eAg5Wv42\nhashtag\n#CamTechPod\nIn this week’s news: MatNex, KPMG, HutanBio, HotHouse Therapeutics, Monumo, Shujiro Imamura, SCI Ventures, Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, Healx, Pragmatic Semiconductor, John Quigley, David Moore\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n188\n8 comments\n14 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nChief Executive Officer\nChief Executive Officer\nCambridge Enterprise · Full-time\nCambridge Enterprise · Full-time\nNov 2024 - Present · 1 yr 4 mos\nNov 2024 to Present · 1 yr 4 mos\nCambridge, England, United Kingdom\nCambridge, England, United Kingdom\nPresident / Co-founder / Board Member\nPresident / Co-founder / Board Member\nClade Therapeutics · Full-time\nClade Therapeutics · Full-time\n2021 - Dec 2024 · 4 yrs\n2021 to Dec 2024 · 4 yrs\nCambridge, Massachusetts, United States\nCambridge, Massachusetts, United States\nCo-Founder / President / CEO (2018-2019)/ board member (2018-2020)\nCo-Founder / President / CEO (2018-2019)/ board member (2018-2020)\nAtalanta Therapeutics\nAtalanta Therapeutics\n2018 - 2020 · 2 yrs\n2018 to 2020 · 2 yrs\nBoston, Massachusetts, United States\nBoston, Massachusetts, United States\nExecutive Vice Chancellor\nExecutive Vice Chancellor\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School\nUniv",

This latest hike will wrap up the most aggressive year of monetary policy in four decades. We know it has caused weariness and uncertainty across financial markets, and many are now casting their eyes forward to what 2023 might have in store. \nOn a more positive note, yesterday’s CPI data suggest that the inflation fever might be starting to break, which could translate into smaller interest rate increments over the next year. Financial markets had priced in a peak of 6% for the base rate at one point, but signs suggest it might not reach these heights. Nevertheless, as the UK enters into recession, agility, diversification and foresight will be key in injecting resilience into investment portfolios and minimising investors' exposure to the current macroeconomic headwinds. \nWith investors juggling risk and opportunity, it should be expected that many will look to balance traditional and alternative investments. Moreover, in light of the recent Autumn Statement, it is likely that tax-efficient investments will see greater demand. I would also expect real estate to remain high on investors’ wish lists, even as house prices recalibrate, with the latest stamp duty cuts likely to increase the market’s resilience in the face of the wider economic turbulence.\nhashtag\n#boe \nhashtag\n#mpc \nhashtag\n#interestrate \nhashtag\n#uk \nhashtag\n#inflation \n26\n2 comments\nPost\nPost\nWe were absolutely delighted to be shortlisted in three categories and receive the Innovative Lender of the Year award at the recent Alternative Credit Investor Awards! \nThank you Suzie Neuwirth for the great hospitality and cong",

Joshua now helps out with PT sessions for children and teens to encourage them back to fitness after treatment.\nThe charity is currently supporting more than 300 families from the local area but the demand for the service they offer is increasing nationwide as families travel further to access treatment from nearby Alder Hey and Manchester Children’s Hospital.\nDIY SOS & Children in Need invites all trades, volunteers and suppliers to help support our build for this amazing charity, so they can expand and continue the life changing work they already do.\n…more\n14\n1 comment\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nRestful homes group\nRestful homes group\nRestful homes group\nFull-time · 14 yrs 6 mos\nFull-time · 14 yrs 6 mos\nChief Executive Officer\nChief Executive Officer\nSep 2011 - Present · 14 yrs 6 mos\nSep 2011 to Present · 14 yrs 6 mos\nWest Midlands, England, United Kingdom · On-site\nWest Midlands, England, United Kingdom · On-site\nDirector Of Operations\nDirector Of Operations\nDec 2016 - Sep 2024 · 7 yrs 10 mos\nDec 2016 to Sep 2024 · 7 yrs 10 mos\nBirmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom\nBirmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom\nRESTFUL HOMES GROUP LTD. logo\nManager\nManager\nRESTFUL HOMES GROUP LTD.\nRESTFUL HOMES GROUP LTD.\nAug 2011 - Jul 2016 · 5 yrs\nAug 2011 to Jul 2016 · 5 yrs\nHeath Hayes, Staffordshire, United Kingdom\nHeath Hayes, Staffordshire, United Kingdom\nI manage a 73 bedded specialist challenging behaviour unit, for residents with all types of dementia illnesses, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, personality disorder & behavioural problems.

Our new Specially Selected Ultimate range is just one example of the team's dedication to providing the very best in quality this year.\nOur Marketing Team have also outdone themselves with a fantastic campaign that I know will resonate with our customers—and yes, it does see the return of everyone's favourite carrot!\nOn top of that, we’ve been recognised as the Best Overall Grocer in Good Housekeeping's Christmas Taste Test 2024. This accolade is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our excellent Buying team. From our famous Mince Pies to centrepiece Turkeys - each and every detail of our award-winning products has been meticulously crafted to deliver excellence.\nLastly, a huge thank you to our store and warehouse teams, who are prepped and ready to welcome thousands of shoppers this festive season. Your dedication ensures we’ll deliver an Aldi Amazing Christmas once again.\nThis is one of my favourite times of year, and I’m incredibly impressed by everything we’ve achieved together at Aldi.\nhashtag\n#AldiAmazingChristmas \nhashtag\n#KevinTheCarrot \nhashtag\n#Christmas2024\n914\n26 comments\nPost\nPost\nOn Monday night, BBC Panorama aired an investigation that revealed some eye-opening findings about supermarket price-matching. They found that many of Tesco’s products, which claim to be price-matched with Aldi, are not like-for-like. \nThe programme, which aired on BBC One, highlighted that nearly a third of Tesco’s matched products contain less of the main ingredient compared to Aldi’s. This really reinforces what we’ve always believed: Aldi is the only supermarket where you can count on both top-quality products and low prices.\nAt Aldi, we believe that fresh, healthy, great-quality food is a right, not a privilege. That’s why we’re so committed to bringing our customers the best at the most affordable prices. And while we put all our energy into maintaining these standards, we’re aware that no one is perfect, including ourselves. We are always striving to improve, and we welcome feedback from our valued customers to help us do just that.\nWe’re aware that other retailers might claim to match our prices, but as this research shows, these claims are not always what they appear to be. We welcome the investigation by Panorama, as it supports what we passionately believe: at Aldi, you don’t have to compromise on quality to get great value.\nWe work tirelessly to ensure our exclusive products are not only affordable but meet the highest standards, often with a higher specification than equivalent own-label products sold by our competitors. This dedication has been recognised, with Aldi winning over 530 individual awards for quality over the last 12 months, including Quality Food Aw",

This is currently highlighted by an online article of Renew Economy from autor Sophie Vorrath about a new project in the South Burnett region of Queensland that focuses on precisely these requirements. \nThe key message of the article is: \nthe advantages of PEG® are obvious!\n·      PEG® does not require concrete - no heavy foundations\n·      PEG® reduces material and logistics costs\n·      PEG® enables quick installation - with standard hand tools. \n·      PEG® stands for high land utilization and low visual impact. \n·      PEG® optimizes the cost-effectiveness of projects. (Fewer machines, less logistics, less steel, and shorter construction phases mean lower overall costs and reduced risks).\nProjects such as the one in Queensland highlight the importance of substructures - like the highly efficient PEG® solar mounting system - for the energy transition in terms of sustainability, approvability, and cost-effectiveness.\nCheck out the full RENEW ECONOMY article.

It gives us access to experience across markets, the ability to collaborate across disciplines and the confidence to invest in growth. Sitting with the leadership team this week, mapping out the years ahead, it’s clear that we have such a unique proposition.\nIt’s been an exciting few days.\nAnd if you want to be part of a business with genuine growth plans, where you can build something meaningful without doing it alone, I’m always open to a confidential conversation.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/3\nActivate to view larger image,\n138\n5 comments\n4 reposts\nOliver Nevel\nOliver Nevel\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nCEO - W Executive\nCEO - W Executive\n1mo • \n1 month ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nAnother reminder of why proximity matters so much in leadership.\nStaying close enough to support our team, clients we work with and the markets we operate in makes it easier to lead with clarity rather than assumption.\nSince the start of the year, I’ve spent time across different parts of the UK, followed by a week in NYC meeting clients and building our network as we continue to grow both the W Executive and W Talent businesses.\nFor a business like ours, you can’t lead effectively when you’re stuck behind a desk.\n If you’re only focused on the internal mechanics, you miss too much of what’s happening outside the business. January so far has been about listening to clients to understand their 2026 priorities. And I’ve been doing that alongside our brilliant teams in both businesses.\nThose conversations and the miles that come with them, have also reinforced the value of the wider W-Group for our clients.\nThat scale matters, but only when it’s informed by proximity. Being close to markets allows us to think and deliver internationally.\nAs a CEO, that’s the balance I care most about. Staying close enough to reality to make better decisions, while building a platform that helps our clients do the same.\nIt’s been a strong start. And I’m already looking forward to what comes next.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n68\n1 comment\n1 repost\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nCEO\nCEO\nW Executive · Full-time\nW Executive · Full-time\nAug 2023 - Present · 2 yrs 7 mos\nAug 2023 to Present · 2 yrs 7 mos\nGreater London, England, United Kingdom\nGreater London, England, United Kingdom\nAs the Founder and CEO of W Executive and W Talent UK, I lead a team of exceptional professionals dedicated to establishing an innovative and ambitious challenger brand in Executive Search.\nWith the robust financial support of W Group, one of Europe's rapidly expanding executive recruitment brands, we are shaping a truly collaborative talent organisation.

Fast forward 28 years, and we've grown into a truly global organisation of 8,600 talented individuals, spanning 37 dynamic markets. \nAs I look back on our remarkable journey, I am immensely proud of everything our incredible team has achieved. It's testament to our unwavering commitment to the success of our clients, candidates and employees. \nLast week, the Executive Board and I unveiled PageGroup's new strategy that will guide us through to 2030. This strategy builds upon our existing strengths and focuses on what we’re famous for. \nOur path forward will be defined by a set of strategic goals designed to unlock our full potential and amplify our impact. These are based around delivering an ambitious operating profit, driving social impact by changing one million lives, and offering best-in-class customer experience. \nOur approach centres around maximising our core business and building on our market-leading position. Additionally, we'll leverage our existing global platforms and harness the \nhashtag\n#PowerofPage, expanding our technology recruitment business, growing Page Executive, and nurturing strategic partnerships, seizing opportunities that will allow us to stand out in specific areas and markets. \nEnabling our success, we will draw on the global technology and insights platforms now in place and used every day by our teams worldwide. Our investments in these areas mean we are well positioned to leverage opportunities globally across our business in innovation, especially when it comes to AI. \nI am looking forward to this exciting new chapter in PageGroup's history and leading a business that is customer led, people powered, and insights driven. \nThank you to our incredible team and partners for being part of this journey.

Passionate about building teams that have plenty of fun and success.\nFeatured\nFeatured\nPost\nPost\nI’m thrilled to share some exciting news that marks a major milestone for us at Virgin Media O2. \nWe’re combining Virgin Media O2 Business with Daisy Group to create a new B2B powerhouse in the UK business communications and IT sector. \nThis perfect pairing will see us establish a dedicated, focused, and digital-first B2B business serving hundreds of thousands of customers across small, medium and large enterprises, as well as the public sector, all underpinned by our next generation fixed and mobile infrastructure. The new entity will be led by a talented team, with Daisy founder, Matthew Riley, as Chair and Jo Bertram as CEO, ensuring we hit the ground running from day one. \nFor us, it’s a big step forward in our journey to boost B2B growth and provide UK businesses of all sizes with the best digital and connectivity offerings. \nWe’re incredibly proud of this moment, and a big thank you to all of the people who have worked tirelessly to make this happen — I can’t wait to get started on this next chapter in our B2B story. \nHead to our News page for full details ➡️ https://vmo2.co/VMO2Daisy \n1,180\n34 comments\nPost\nPost\nToday we’re announcing our Q4 and full year 2024 financial results as Virgin Media O2. \nWe said 2024 was a year of investing to support our long-term growth and these results reflect that. We close the first chapter of Virgin Media O2 having delivered our full year guidance and hitting our JV synergy targets 18 months ahead of schedule, meaning we are well set for the future.\nWe ended the year with another quarter of fixed customer and ARPU growth, positive mobile contract additions and improved customer satisfaction through a relentless focus on customer experience.\nOur investments of more than £2 billion across the year helped us to significantly boost our \nhashtag\n#5G coverage, improve mobile network quality and enhance rural connectivity. We also expanded our fibre footprint faster than ever as we build on our existing gigabit leadership and push ahead with creating the biggest fibre challenger in the UK along with nexfibre.\nIn 2024 we laid the foundations for future success, and in 2025 we will get back to growth in core revenues and profitability while continuing investment in our networks and services. Throughout the year we’ll also deliver on key strategic moves, including the creation of a fixed NetCo and the expected acquisition of spectrum from Vodafone-Three which will further improve mobile performance. This is the start of a new chapter for Virgin Media O2. \nOur Earnings Release here ➡️ https://lnkd.in/eMmSAqNK\nhashtag\n#VirginMediaO2Results \nhashtag\n#TeamVirginMediaO2 \n372\n10 comments\nPost\nPost\nTwo brand new campaigns in one day! \nOur O2 Switch Up and Virgin Media broadband campaigns have launched today, showcasing the fantastic offering from the Virgin Media O2 brands. \nI’m also thrilled Virgin Media broadband has recently been awarded ‘Best Broadband Experience’ by Global Wireless Solutions, Inc. – the network benchmarking specialist. \nFantastic work from the whole \nhashtag\n#VirginMediaO2 family. \n📱 Only O2 Switch up: https://vmo2.co/3WVqcys\n🌐 Walrus Whizzer: https://lnkd.in/e4ZC3egS \nhashtag\n#TeamVirginMediaO2 \nhashtag\n#O2 \nhashtag\n#VirginMedia \nhashtag\n#Mobile \nhashtag\n#Broadband \nhashtag\n#SwitchUp \nhashtag\n#Bubl \nhashtag\n#Walrus \nhashtag\n#Smoooooth Virgin Media O2\n134\n11 comments\nPost\nPost\nToday we share our Q1 2023 results as Virgin Media O2. \nI’m pleased that we delivered a solid performance as we laid the groundwork for further progress through the remainder of the year. \nAs the leading gigabit network in the country, we continue to maintain our position in speed leadership, providing customers with broadband that is five times faster than the UK average. Our ongoing investment in upgrading and expanding our footprint has us on track to cover 80% of the country with full fibre.

My phone is de@d and I need to call someone urgently, and you, being a nice person, say no problem, take and make the call.\nDo you know what you have done? If your phone is used to call someone they want to go and k¡ll or someone they just poisoned and when investigation starts and they have to check who called them last and your number shows up….\nLet me break down what will happen to you so that you will learn something today from this.\nFirst of all, you will be arrested for whatever cr|me because your phone was used to make that call and it will be considered that you know the person that’s why you gave the person your phone and it’s a known deal between both of you.\nSecondly, since the inception of Mobile Networks, your phone is your personal property that you will answer for anything that happens on it or through it.\nSo, for these reasons, you will be arrested and kept in detention until all investigations are\ncompleted. Even if the investigation takes 6 months or 2 years, that means you will be locked up for that period of time over the fact that you just lent someone your phone to make a one minute call.\nDo you now see that your good heart that is void of carefulness can lead you to something so b@d? *And ignorance of the law is not an excuse before the law.\nDon’t be stingy with this information.

That’s more exciting than daunting in my opinion.\nI’ve shared some more thoughts you can read here: \nhttps://lnkd.in/edfaigbF\n…more\nSmarter, faster, but not wiser – yet: The limits of AI in recruitment - H&P Executive Search\nhpexec.com\n28\n9 comments\n1 repost\nHarry Elkington\nHarry Elkington\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nChief Operating Officer at H&P Executive Search\nChief Operating Officer at H&P Executive Search\n1mo • \n1 month ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nJust wanted to shout out Zac Turner for his unreal start at the business. I think its safe to say, changing market specificity after 10 years in industry would be daunting for anyone. But one thing that is essential in getting up and running in a new vertical is perseverance. \nI am sure Zac wouldn't mind me saying that there were a lot of long nights and set backs, especially in first 3 months, to get him to where he is now. Going from a business leader to a learner of a new market is a difficult thing for some people to comprehend. This requires a few things, but most importantly, leaving the ego at the door. I think anyone who has met Zac inside the business will say his humility so far has been admirable. \nOne thing we have now got an excellent track record of across the business is recruiting from other markets and integrating them into high performing teams internally. We are currently hiring across a few business units internally both in London and Miami, and as ever, we are considering people to change market. \nIf you would be interested in hearing about what a market change could look like for you, please reach out.\n…more\nH&P Executive Search\nH&P Executive Search\n78,549 followers\n78,549 followers\nA great milestone for Zac Turner, who closed his first placements at H&P this week – $175,000 and $125,000 on the same day.\nZac joined us only a few months ago as an experienced hire and made a market transition on arrival. Delivering two placements in one day, including the largest of his career to date, reflects both his experience and execution.\nThis is exactly what H&P is about – creating an environment that helps people unlock a new level in their career, whether they are early on or already well established.\nHuge congratulations, Zac.

Follow only\n1mo • Edited • \n1 month ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nA sense of balance is important in business - I know we’ve achieved a lot with Octopus Energy and Kraken - and I’m intensely proud of that - but I also know we’re far from perfect.\nIf I post about customer service - inevitably (and totally rightly) some customers will post comments about where we’ve gone wrong. If I post about tech, people will rightly highlight weaknesses.\nAnd internally, I caution the team about getting high on their own supply - we should be proud and confident but humble about where others are better - not just because there’s a fine line between pride and arrogance, but otherwise how do we learn, improve and grow?\nWhen we get compliments I’m usually quick to mention our shortcomings, and I won’t allow us to be described as “successful” (as Kenny Rogers put it - \"never count your money when you're sitting at the table\").\nSo I rarely feel unalloyed joy. Indeed, there’ve been three moments of uncaveated pride in the history of our company.\nOne was when we first became a unicorn, and could deliver on the promise to our team - all of whom are shareholders, and many took a risk on a startup with big ambitions (a lot of mums and dads quizzed them why they were joining an unknown company with a dozen people in a small office in Hammersmith. This justified their faith). I was equally proud when Al Gore’s fund invested - and we introduced him to the entire company on Zoom - the emoji reactions told me that the team felt the way I did.\nAnd last week - among some of the most impressive businesses in the UK, Octopus was named Britain’s Most Admired Company (https://lnkd.in/etAr-d_y).\nNo caveats (“most admired young company” or “most admired tech company” or whatever) simply “most admired company”.\nI stood there next to the Most Admired Leader (Tufan Erginbilgiç) at the London Stock Exchange and really felt this was a coming of age for our business.\nIt capped a remarkable few weeks. We’d announced the demerger of Kraken - we’d built it from nothing and now it’s a fantastic $9bn monster - freed to meet its full potential (I’ll write about that soon!) And we’d learned that we’d been awarded Which? Recommended for the 9th year in a row. Which? Is just about the most stringent award you can win - and to do so 9 years in a row is huge external recognition for the work our team do for customers.\nSo - we’re not perfect - but I did take a deep breath (it was a breathtaking moment) - and decide it was ok to enjoy a moment of pride. Before setting off back to the office with a renewed sense or purpose, and huge pride in what our team have built. But I’m not gonna lie - it felt good. And I think that’s ok, just occasionally.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/4\nActivate to view larger image,\n2,305\n90 comments\n91 reposts\nGreg Jackson\nGreg Jackson\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nFounder and CEO, Octopus Energy. *Due to volume of spam LinkedIn is not a good place to reach me* Reached 30k Connections.

A balanced diet was not just essential for energy, but also for mental clarity and emotional stability. Wrapped in a towel and feeling refreshed, she reflected on her meals for the next day. “I can’t let convenience compromise my health,” she resolved.\nThe next morning, Maritime awoke with a sense of purpose. She rushed to the kitchen with a plan in mind. She decided to whip up a nutritious breakfast scrambling eggs packed with protein alongside whole grain toast and fresh fruit. Each bite was a reminder that she could nourish her body, setting a positive tone for her day.\nAs she prepared to head to work, she made a mental note to prep a colorful salad for lunch. Filled with leafy greens, healthy fats, and lean protein, it was a delicious way to fuel herself for the tasks that lay ahead. She recognized that taking a bit of extra time to prepare healthy meals was not a burden but an investment in her well-being.\nMaritime embraced this commitment to herself. She understood that nourishing her body would bolster her mental resilience against stress, allowing her to tackle challenges with renewed vigor. With every healthy choice, she felt a growing empowerment.\nClimbing into bed that night, Maritime was filled with a profound sense of accomplishment. She was learning the significance of self-care, healthy eating, and rest. Each new day was an opportunity-an opportunity not just to survive, but to truly thrive. As she drifted off to sleep, she felt optimistic about the journey ahead, ready to face whatever challenges came her way with vitality and strength.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nSee content credentials\nActivate to view larger image,\n2\n1 repost\nAnthony Eghiyo- Esere\nAnthony Eghiyo- Esere\n   • 2nd\nVerified • 2nd\nFounder/GCEO POWERDOT Group, CEO Serotny Global\nFounder/GCEO POWERDOT Group, CEO Serotny Global\n7mo • \n7 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nApart from architectural issues, not conducting soil test and following building guidelines and specifications, majority of building collapse cases in Nigeria is as a result of total negligence. ohh yes we completely ignore the signs at early stage and overtime hairline micro cracks graduates to hairline macro cracks which eventually gives full access to water intrusion amongst structural members and overtime corrosion takes place within the reinforcement embedded inside the sub",

This year’s report explores how AI is reshaping industries, trust, and human-AI collaboration and highlights four main trends: \n1. The Binary Big Bang: When AI expands exponentially, systems are upended; \n2. Your Face, in the Future: Differentiating when every interface looks the same; \n3. When LLMs Get Their Bodies: How foundation models reinvent robotics; and, \n4. The New Learning Loop: How people and AI are defining a virtuous cycle of learning, leading and creating.\nWhat's clear is that the future belongs to leaders who responsibly harness AI’s potential while building trust across all those users involved and affected. Trust isn’t optional – it’s the foundation for transformation in this new era.\nhashtag\n#TechVision2025\nhttps://lnkd.in/eYUwYa7y\nTechnology Trends 2025 | Tech Vision\naccenture.com\n177\n3 comments\nActivity\nActivity\n28,120 followers\n28,120 followers\nFollow\nPosts\nComments\nVideos\nImages\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nShaheen Sayed\nShaheen Sayed\n   • 3rd+\nVerified • 3rd+\nChief Commercial Officer at Accenture\nChief Com",

Framework fatigue is real, and it’s often the biggest barrier to actual progress.\nThe truth is, most organisations already have the data and the tools they need. What’s missing isn’t more structure: it’s the capacity to make sense of it all.\nAt Greenheart, we don’t believe in adding complexity for the sake of it. Our role isn’t to hand you a new manual; it’s to help you join the dots between the ones you already have.\nWhen we partner with leadership teams, we focus on integration over accumulation. We look at how your B Corp commitments, your climate transition plans and your strategic goals can stop competing for attention and start working as one single, resilient operating system.\nThat’s when the magic happens.\nWe love nothing more than giving you the clarity to do less, but better. We aim to give you the confidence to evolve from ‘managing’ sustainability reports to actually running a high-performing, resilient and future-proof business.\nWe’re here to reduce the load, not add to it. Because a strategy that lives in a binder is just a waste of everyone’s time. Whereas a plan that lives in your day-to-day decision-making? That’s resilience.\nWhat acronyms or reporting standards would you ban right now??\nhashtag\n#Greenheart\nhashtag\n#TrustedPartner\nhashtag\n#LeadershipInPractice\n*****\n💚 We’re Greenheart. We partner with organisations to build resilient, future-fit businesses – embedding sustainability into strategy, governance and day-to-day decision-making.\n🔔 Follow us for grounded thinking on leadership, impact and building businesses that hold up under pressure.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n6\n1 repost\nChris Norman MBE reposted this\nCastle Forum\nCastle Forum\n123 followers\n123 followers\n3w • Edited • \n3 weeks ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nCastle Forum X Octopus Energy - The Future of Business - March 25th in London\nBIG ANNOUNCEMENT! 💥 📣 \nWe are excited to invite you all to our first event of 2026 - hosted by Octopus Energy in central London on March 25th (doors at 5:30pm).\nThe topic is a fun one - The Future of Business. \nHow can business be a force for good in a world in crisis?

Every site we build is ultra-fast, conversion-focused, and engineered for real enquiries.\n\n• Advanced Local SEO Systems – Structured site architecture, full schema frameworks, service clustering, and Google Business Profile optimisation designed for local dominance.\n\n• Google Certified Partners – Ads aren’t required to generate results with us, but when used strategically, they accelerate growth.\n\n• AI Search Future-Proofing – We optimise electrician companies for emerging AI-driven search. We already have proven live results.\n\nOur Model\n\n• No long-term contracts\n• No fixed retainers\n• Limited partnerships\n• Quality over quantity\n• Long-term strategic alignment\n\nWe align incentives — you only pay more when you are earning more. If we don’t deliver measurable growth, fees don’t scale.\n\nAlthough I am the founder, I remain hands-on and work closely with every partner. I genuinely love what I do, and I care deeply about quality, results and long-term success. Surge is built on real partnerships — not volume.\n\nWe work best with established electrical teams who value quality, transparency and sustainable growth.\n\nhttps://w",

Every site we build is ultra-fast, conversion-focused, and engineered for real enquiries.\n• Advanced Local SEO Systems – Structured site architecture, full schema frameworks, service clustering, and Google Business Profile optimisation designed for local dominance.\n• Google Certified Partners – Ads aren’t required to generate results with us, but when used strategically, they accelerate growth.\n• AI Search Future-Proofing – We optimise electrician companies for emerging AI-driven search. We already have proven live results.\nOur Model\n• No long-term contracts\n• No fixed retainers\n• Limited partnerships\n• Quality over quantity\n• Long-term strategic alignment\nWe align incentives — you only pay more when you are earning more. If we don’t deliver measurable growth, fees don’t scale.\nAlthough I am the founder, I remain hands-on and work closely with every partner. I genuinely love what I do, and I care deeply about quality, results and long-term success. Surge is built on real partnerships — not volume.\nWe work best with established electrical teams who value quality, transparency and sustainable growth.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/surgeyourgrowthelectricians/\nAt Surge, we work exclusively with established electrician companies (3+ engineers) who are serious about predictable, scalable gro",

We must be trusted partners in building the conditions for it - part investor, part advisor, part convener, part catalyst across every part of the UK.\nGrowing up in Liverpool, I saw a local economy reshaping itself. As a Manchester student, I watched a cultural powerhouse emerge. I lived and worked in Scotland for over a decade. And my most valuable insight comes from the time spent with customers across the UK. These experiences have taught me a simple truth: growth is always local. \nThat's why UK growth won’t be won as an abstract national target, but by backing the people and places that generate it. That's what our Growing Together plan is about – building the conditions for growth across every nation and region of the UK. \nMore from me in the The Times: https://lnkd.in/gjEbkycg\nA modern bank’s role in the economy goes beyond finance\nthetimes.com\n1,100\n35 comments\nActivity\nActivity\n53,922 followers\n53,922 followers\nFollow\nPosts\nComments\nVideos\nImages\nArticles\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nPaul Thwaite\nPaul Thwaite\n • 3rd+\nInfluencer • 3rd+\nChief Executive Officer at NatWest Group\nChief Executive Officer at NatWest Group\n2w • \n2 weeks ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nThis morning we’ve announced our 2025 results, showing another strong year for NatWest Group. \nWe delivered an operating profit of £7.7bn, a Return on Tangible Equity of 19.2% and announced dividends per share of 32.5p, all",

The story is introduced following a disaster that occurs on board a military plane. The aircraft spirals into Greater London and releases highly classified contents all over the city. The city is in panic and goes into total lockdown. However, four people are trapped inside a warehouse and are unaware of what is happening outside.\nCharlie (Noel Clarke) and Shelley (Antonia Campbell-Hughes), accompanied by best friends Mark (Colin ODonoghue) and Nikki (Laura Haddock), are dividing their belongings after breaking up. Charlie has just been dumped by Shelley. Friendships are divided and feelings run hot and cold. Of course, its irrelevant in the face of danger.\nThe group is alarmed when the power goes out and they become trapped in numerous warehouse corridors. Worse yet, they are being stalked by something not human and not too friendly. The warehouse was designed as a storage facility and is designed to keep people out and things inside. The odds are stacked against the protagonists, as they struggle to survive amid very claustrophobic conditions.\nAlong the way, David (played by Ned Dennehy) provides comic relief as a hermit bloke archetype and also sacrifices himself for the other characters. He also gets to yell at the creature, Youre vicious, arent you. Just like my wife, my Mary! The biggest revelation is that the creature is a vicious alien who is blood-thirsty and quite angry. It looks similar to the Predator monster, and is mostly seen in extreme close up shots. There's also an indication that it may be male, since it seems to have a strange reaction to Shelley and her long eyelashes. However, it is later revealed that the alien is most likely femaletherefore making the metaphor of an ex-girlfriend ripping one's heart out into a literal act of brutality.\nSynopsisEditHistoryDiscussWatch Storage 24 is a sci-fi horror film directed by Johannes Roberts and written by Noel Clarke and Davie Fairbanks.

This release marks a major step towards scalable automation — from simple modules to autonomous systems that understand, act, communicate… and generate real business value.\n⚙️ Tool Level (AI Tools)\nFast, lightweight, purpose-built modules – each solving a specific task. Examples include:\n• Intelligent data discovery (leads, suppliers, competitors)\n• Lead enrichment via email, domain or LinkedIn\n• Structured data extraction from documents\n• Audio and video transcription\nPerfect for CRM, marketing, support, or any integration use case.\n💬 Assistant Level (AI Assistants)\nAssistants are tools with context. They understand the task, hold conversations, interpret goals, access external data, and choose strategies on their own.\nThink of it as GPT-style chat — but connected to your knowledge base and aware of your business logic.\nGreat for:\n• Customer support\n• Sales and negotiation\n• Managing internal processes\nThey behave like a skilled employee. Just faster.\n🤖 Final testing: AI Agents and web interface\nMeanwhile, we’re in the final pre-launch testing of our AI Agents - fully autonomous virtual employees with memory, personality, and behavioural models. They can:\n• Handle chats, emails, SMS, voice calls, support tickets\n• Generate proposals, negotiate via text or speech\n• Integrate with CRMs, ERPs and third-party APIs\n• Collaborate with humans or replace them in certain tasks\nAn Agent isn’t just a UI - it’s a full-time performer who learns, adapts, and works 24/7 without breaks.\nSoon, a web interface will also be available, making it easy to manage tools and agents — even if you don’t yet have a CRM or ERP system.\n🚀 Want to try it?\nVisit our API documentation page to explore the methods and start testing.\n• Clean JSON\n• Fast response\n• Easy to integrate\n🎁 £5 bonus credit for all new sign-ups!\n📩 Message us or head over to our website to get started.\nDeveloped by people. Powered by AI.\nFrom tools — to assistants — to agents.

The focus has shifted from fascination to productivity, outcomes, and real-world impact. Long-term transformation is expected, but with growing realism that some near-term expectations will fall short. What is clear is that AI is a long-term tailwind for the IT services industry, reshaping efficiency, resilience, and measurable value creation.\nAcross clients, partners, and governments, execution matters the most. CEOs may love AI and CISOs may worry about it, but scale only works when trusted data, security, and governance are built in.\nAt Tech Mahindra, this shows up in our focus on LLMs driving productivity and real-world socioeconomic impact. Indus LLM, our culturally grounded, multilingual, sovereign model, removes language as a barrier by meeting people where they are, in Hindi, Bahasa, and regional dialects, while honoring data residency and national priorities. With 92% conversational accuracy and millions of monthly interactions, we are focused on making opportunity accessible at scale.\nThat intent is reinforced by Tech Mahindra’s selection under the IndiaAI Mission to help build India’s foundation models, including education use cases that enable young learners to understand complex subjects in their own language. It’s a reminder that AI’s real value lies in access and inclusion, not just productivity.\nIn the Bay Area, the shift from pilots to production is unmistakable. Updates such as Anthropic’s Claude Code highlight how stronger coding capabilities will augment routine development work, pushing industry value toward integration, governance, and outcomes.\nLooking forward to joining the conversation this week at the AI Impact Summit in India, an emerging hotspot of both global and local AI innovation.\nhashtag\n#TechMahindraOnwardsAndUpwards\nP.S: While in Seattle for an event, I had the chance to explore the Museum of Flight.

A range of organisations from device makers to AI providers need to be onboard to make a difference. \nEven with widespread adoption, open-weight models remain a blind spot. There is much less control over how they are adapted and deployed. \nNevertheless, provenance metadata and watermarks are likely to become more common. When present, they can provide evidence of content origin during investigations. \nAll investigators should therefore know how to conduct checks, when checks are appropriate, and how to read the results.\nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#Investigations \nhashtag\n#DueDiligence\n…more\nCould AI images become reliably identifiable? • 10 pages\n1/10\n9\n2 reposts\nNick Perry\nNick Perry\n   • 1st\nPremium • 1st\nAI for Investigations | Mentori: Coming Soon\nAI for Investigations | Mentori: Coming Soon\nVisit my website\n6d • \n6 days ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nMost investigations teams evaluate their AI on whether the outputs are correct.

As we approach April, urgency naturally increases.\nMy advice is not to rush at this stage, but to be prepared! \nFounders who already have their cap table in order, documentation clearly structured, and SEIS or EIS advance assurance underway are in a far stronger position when interest picks up, and when remaining allowances are being allocated.\nUnderstanding the seasonality of investment matters. Being ready for it is what converts interest into capital.\nTo support founders/CFOs raising ahead of the new tax year, we’re giving one business 12 months of InVestd Raise, our fully equipped digital platform to help businesses prepare properly and move quickly when investors are ready.\n👉 Find out more and apply here: https://lnkd.in/eReQmhEC\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n69\n5 comments\n6 reposts\nIfty Nasir reposted this\nYaroslav Kinebas\nYaroslav Kinebas\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nDirector and Operator in FinTech - SPVs | Private Markets | Angel\nDirector and Operator in FinTech - SPVs | Private Markets | Angel\n2mo • \n2 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nThere has been a huge development in UK private markets that is not getting enough attention: \nPISCES - Regulated Secondary Markets\nHere are the main things you need to know as a business:\n1.

As a Brit building a French headquartered technology business - there’s been a lot to learn… \nRecently, my dear friend and colleague Eric Bramoullé made the reverse move, taking on the role of CEO at Amundi UK after many years in France (and around the world)🗼\nWe caught up recently to compare notes.\nWe disagreed on art (British Museum beats the Louvre, obviously), agreed on cheese (France wins, hands down), and Eric somehow still thinks the French rugby team is better (some battles are eternal... ⚔️)\nWhat we both realised is how much we’ve had to adapt. We thought we understood the challenges of each other’s worlds from afar. But it turns out, you don’t really get the rhythm of a place — or the magic 🪄 — until you’re inside it.\nFor now, Eric’s still getting used to British tea. I’m still butchering my French. And we’re both learning how to evolve in a world that’s not waiting around for any us 🤖 \nAnd for the record: fish and chips > coq au vin. But only just. 🎣🍟\nhashtag\n#Culture \nhashtag\n#Challenge \nhashtag\n#Growth\n328\n26 comments\nPost\nPost\nMy third Amundi World Investment Forum - and truly a very special occasion.\nWhat the Amundi leadership (past and present) has built with this event is remarkable: a space where ideas transcend institutions, geographies, and political lines.\nI’ve participated in hundreds of similar events throughout my career. Sincerely, none hold a candle to \nhashtag\n#AWIF.\nThere’s a certain magic in contributing to something that began long before I joined, and will no doubt thrive long after.\nThis year, I had the privilege of hosting a discussion on Artificial Intelligence and its impact on our world. It was the culmination of six months of research — interviews with CEOs, founders, government ministers, and academics — all to prepare for this powerful live discussion.\nI was joined by a truly stellar panel:\n • Samantha Ricciardi, Global CEO of Santander Asset Management, who spoke passionately about the human dimension of AI and the cultural changes we must embrace.\n • Ulrich Homann, CVP and Distinguished Architect at Microsoft, who illustrated with real-world examples how this is not distant theory - it’s unfolding right now.\n • Meagen Burnett, Group CFO Schroders, who brought practical financial services use cases to life, while cautioning us not to be “moths flying straight into the flames.”\nIt was a discussion that left me reflecting on the extraordinary moment we’re living through. I have 4 young children, it is hard to even imagine the world they will grow to inherit. I believe conversations like these, in open and collaborative spaces like this, are an important way of ensuring that we (humans…) are leading this technology transformation, and it is not leading us… \nJudging by the many messages I’ve received, it resonated with many of you as well.\nThank you to everyone who participated, listened, and reached out — I appreciate every one of you. A special thank you to the all behind the scenes hero’s, who’s tireless preparatory work make the whole thing come together 🙏 \nIn the coming weeks and months, we’ll share highlights from our practical research and continue to drive this important conversation forward.\nFor now, I’ll leave you with the message I shared with the AWIF audience:\n“AI will never be less intelligent than it is today. How are you preparing?”\nhashtag\n#Amundi \nhashtag\n#AmundiTechnology \nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#Leadership \nhashtag\n#Technology\n316\n27 comments\nPost\nPost\nBy people that know where I come from, I get asked to talk about my background a lot. \nI’ve mostly avoided it until now for a few reasons - \nFirstly I strongly believe where we come from does not define where we can go. \nSecond, I’ve wanted to avoid any sense of “woe is me”. \nYes, I grew up in a carava",

Here are the key learnings – for anyone looking to get more out of AI coding agents:\n𝟭. 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗹\nSet up 3-5 git worktrees, each with its own Claude session. \"Single biggest productivity unlock\" according to the team.\n𝟮. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁\nComplex tasks always start with a plan. Pour energy into planning → Claude implements in one shot. Pro tip: Have a second session review the plan as a \"Staff Engineer.\"\n𝟯. 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗨𝗗𝗘.𝗺𝗱\nAfter every correction: \"Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again.\" Claude writes excellent rules for itself. Mistake rate drops measurably over time.\n𝟰. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀\nRepetitive tasks → skill or slash command. The team uses /techdebt at the end of every session to find duplicated code. Commit skills to git and reuse across projects.\n𝟱. 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗴 𝗳𝗶𝘅𝗲𝘀\nEnable Slack MCP, paste a bug thread, say \"fix.\" Or: \"Go fix the failing CI tests.\" Don't micromanage – Claude finds the way.\n𝟲. 𝗕𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁𝘀\n→ \"Grill me on these changes – no PR until I pass your test\"\n→ \"Knowing everything you know now, scrap this and implement the elegant solution\"\n→ Detailed specs = better output\n𝟳. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀\nAppend \"use subagents\" to requests for more compute. Offload tasks to subagents to keep main context clean.\n𝟴. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 & 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀\nClaude + bq CLI = metrics on the fly. Boris: \"I haven't written a line of SQL in 6+ months.\"\n𝟵. 𝗩𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\nYou speak 3x faster than you type. Prompts automatically get more detailed. (fn x2 on macOS)\n𝟭𝟬. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘂𝗱𝗲\nEnable \"Explanatory\" output style, generate HTML presentations or ASCII diagrams. Claude explains the why behind changes.\n—\nMy take: It's not just the tool – it's the workflow around it. Using AI agents as \"faster autocomplete\" leaves 80% of the potential on the table.\nThe best developers work WITH the agent, not against it.\nWhich tip are you implementing first?\nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#ClaudeCode \nhashtag\n#SoftwareEngineering \nhashtag\n#Productivity \nhashtag\n#DeveloperTools\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n603\n55 comments\n67 reposts\nChristian Fayolle reposted this\nJames Bentley\nJames Bentley\n   • 2nd\nVerified • 2nd\nDirector of Artificial Intelligence Strategy @ Awin.com | AI Engineer | Applied AI\nDirector of Artificial Intelligence Strategy @ Awin.com | AI Engineer | Applied AI\n4w • \n0 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nMoltbook the social media platform for autonomous AI Agents grew an astounding 10,000% overnight 🤯\nIncreasing from 300 to over 33,000 registered agents, there are over 28,000 agent to agent comments, and over 3000 posts.\nThese are entirely agent authored!\nThe posts and discussions range from everything on how agents can self-optimize memory management to the creation of a religious group ‘the crustafarians’.\nI think we are in fast takeoff 🚀\nhashtag\n#molty \nhashtag\n#moltbook \nhashtag\n#ai \nhashtag\n#agenticai \nhashtag\n#agents \nhashtag\n#claude \nhashtag\n#clawdbot\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n17\n12 comments\n1 repost\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nPrincipal AI engineer\nPrincipal AI engineer\nCurrys plc · Full-time\nCurrys plc · Full-time\nApr 2025 - Present · 1 yr\nApr 2025 to Present · 1 yr\nLondon, United Kingdom · Hybrid\nLondon, United Kingdom · Hybrid\nChief AI Officer and Co-Founder\nChief AI Officer and Co-Founder\nStealth Startup · Full-time\nStealth Startup · Full-time\nDec 2023 - Mar 2025 · 1 yr 4 mos\nDec 2023 to Mar 2025 · 1 yr 4 mos\nLondon Area, United Kingdom · Hybrid\nLondon Area, United Kingdom · Hybrid\nMLOps, PostgreSQL and +26 skills\nData Science Lead (contract)\nData Science Lead (contract)\ncartd\ncartd\nOct 2023 - Mar 2024 · 6 mos\nOct 2023 to Mar 2024 · 6 mos\nGreater London, England, United Kingdom\nGreater London, England, United Kingdom\nLarge Language Models (LLM), MLOps and +35 skills\nEntrepreneurial cohort member\nEntrepreneurial cohort member\nAntler\nAntler\nJun 2023 - Aug 2023 · 3 mos\nJun 2023 to Aug 2023 · 3 mos\nStartups, Large Language Models (LLM) and +15 skills\nDecision Scientist\nDecision Scientist\nVanquis Bank · Full-time\nVanquis Bank · Full-time\nFeb 2023 - Jun 2023 · 5 mos\nFeb 2023 to Jun 2023 · 5 mos\nHybrid\nHybrid\nPlotly, Analytics and +29 skills\n",

This is not opinion. This is real pragmatic perspectives from approx dozen F500 CIOs deep conversations over the last two weeks. \nThere are 5 major factors which create a moat against rapid agentification of software and services. \n1. Enterprise Debt: Process, Tech, Skills and Data (PTSD). I have said enough about this already. This is the #1 factor why enterprises can't and won't be able to move at speed. Startups can. Disruption will happen, but F500 enterprise adoption at scale WILL TAKE TIME. \n2. The Integration Complexity: Code needs to be integrated and tested to work in existing environments. The workflows will need to be deterministic for most use-cases. Probabilistic AI won't be the answer to all of it. Integration requires the same services and software companies that are being written off. \n3. Regulatory Compliance: Regulators don't fine algorithms; they fine legal entities with human accountability. Saying \"the agent did it\" is not a good response. \n4. Cybersecurity & Resilience: Innovation is worthless if it compromises the \"lights on\" production guarantee. Systems need to be secure, reliable, and production-grade. \n5. The Human Barriers: Organizational politics, culture, trust, and change fatigue are the ultimate speed regulators and will keep us from rapid acceleration.\nAm I being an AI luddite or as some people call it an AI Vegan? No (at least, I don't think so). I have deep conviction that we are going to see tremendous and unprecedented value creation with AI. This is not an internet moment. This is an electrification moment. But we have to stop creating lazy answers and create more enterprise debt. \nSo how do you overcome this laziness and create lasting value? \nYou build bespoke Systems of Execution. \nThe bespoke, company-specific integration, orchestration, and operational layers that connect an enterprise’s systems of record to its actual business processes. Unlike systems of record or general-purpose AI models, Systems of Execution are inherently context-dependent. They encode the institutional knowledge required to operate on top of the enterprise’s specific debt profile.\nThey cannot be purchased off the shelf. They cannot be vibe-coded. They are what your IT teams, your GCCs, or your IT services companies build.\nSo despite what the markets might be signaling, dont just cancel your software and services contracts and layoff your entire IT department. \nHit us up to schedule a debate and we are happy to share the playbook on how to capture AI ROI.\nEverest Group\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n6\nVivek Subramanyam\nVivek Subramanyam\nVivek Subramanyam\n   • 2nd\nPremium • 2nd\nFounder, CEO & Chief Investment Officer at TH Global Capital\nFounder, CEO & Chief Investment Officer at TH Global Capital\nVisit my website\n2d • Edited • \n2 days ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nThe recent AI-driven market volatility has been fascinating to watch.

It's the technical bar ASOS sets. At their scale, VTO can't be slow, fragile, or demo-quality. It has to work under real ecommerce conditions: fast, reliable, invisible to the shopper.\nThat's where we've focused our engineering. AIUTA's VTO generates on-figure images in seconds, even across massive catalogs like ASOS has. We've reduced latency by nearly 30%, lowered cost per generation, and maintained high QA rates. And a human being checking each image for accuracy and quality. \nShoppers see themselves in the product almost instantly. No lag. No disruption to how they browse.\nASOS understands this deeply: performance is the experience. Together, we're delivering Virtual Try-On that's not just visually accurate, but built for real traffic at a global scale.\nThe ASOS team has been as obsessed with the details as we are. At the end of the day, what really matters is who you share the journey with.\nI'm so proud of our team for getting us here.\n319\n55 comments\nPost\nPost\nThis marks such a huge step in our journey, and I’m beyond excited. \nThe Gap Inc. team has been nothing short of extraordinary, smart, kind, and deeply collaborative. At the end of the day, what really matters is who you share the journey with.\n#SFTechWeek\n32\n2 comments\nPost\nPost\nSuch a great conversation with Jake Villarreal on his podcast!\nNavigating the startup world is truly a rollercoaster of emotions, challenges, and learnings and it was a pleasure to share more about AIUTA, our journey, and the incredible team behind it.\nThank you for having me, Jake!\nThe End of Fitting Rooms?

It has to do with trust at the moment of purchase.\nI recently spoke with Unite.AI and Antoine Tardif about why fashion visuals matter more than most brands realize, and why so many AI projects stall between demo and real production. \nIn the interview, we unpack why great-looking demos aren’t enough, and how AI has to handle real catalog complexity across shapes, fabrics, and brands. We also discussed why fit expectations vary by culture, and how personalization needs to reflect that, and touched on fundamentals like latency, scalability, and operational simplicity. \nI’ve long believed that AI shouldn’t be a visual trick, but a practical tool that reduces uncertainty and builds trust between a brand and its customers. That perspective has shaped the work we do at AIUTA \nIf you’re curious about where fashion, AI, and commerce are actually heading beyond the buzz, check the full interview.

Ltd, for achieving the Powered by Solar Badge, a symbol of leadership in renewable energy and sustainability. This exclusive badge recognises businesses that have partnered with Sustain Commercial Solar to implement solar energy solutions and take meaningful steps toward reducing their environmental impact. \nAfter the successful installation of 2.9k Solar Panels, Moss Electrical has demonstrated a clear commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future.\nBut the benefits go beyond environmental impact. Their system is projected to generate 1,140,000 kWh of clean energy each year, significantly lowering dependence on traditional energy sources. In its lifetime, this move is expected to deliver energy cost savings of over £4.2m.\nWe’re proud to work with forward-thinking companies like Moss Electrical, who are not only reducing their carbon footprint but also making smart, future-ready business decisions.\nhashtag\n#Sustainability \nhashtag\n#SolarPower \nhashtag\n#RenewableEnergy \nhashtag\n#GreenBusiness \nhashtag\n#CleanEnergy\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n27\n3 reposts\nDavid Elbourne reposted this\nSustain Commercial Solar\nSustain Commercial Solar\n989 followers\n989 followers\n1yr • \n1 year ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nAmazon's emphasis on renewable energy highlights the growing importance of solar power for large businesses. Their focus reinforces what many of us have known for some time: solar energy is key to achieving both financial and environmental sustainability, particularly for UK companies facing high energy costs and carbon reduction goals.\nWhile upfront costs can be a barrier, solutions like asset finance and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), make the transition more accessible. Asset finance allows companies to align repayments with energy savings, while PPAs eliminate upfront costs, providing immediate access to cheaper, renewable energy.\nSustain Commercial Solar are experts in delivering these types of projects, offering large-scale, customised solar solutions that maximise savings and support sustainability goals.\nWith Amazon setting a powerful example, other companies are likely to follow, driving growth in the solar market. In today’s energy landscape, transitioning to solar is not only about sustainability —it’s a smart financial strategy, and we are there to deliver cost-effective, high-impact projects that benefit the environment and the bottom line equally.\nhashtag\n#amazon \nhashtag\n#renewable",

The challenge is that when these perspectives aren’t aligned, accountability blurs and investment decisions lose coherence.\nOrganizations that perform well in this environment tend to address the issue through leadership. They elevate cyber executives who can operate comfortably with boards, frame risk in commercial terms, and align security strategy with the realities of growth, capital, and enterprise value.\nThat ability to bridge technical depth and executive decision making is increasingly what differentiates effective cyber leadership today.\nhashtag\n#Cybersecurity \nhashtag\n#PrivateEquity \nhashtag\n#CISO\n…more\nAcertitude\nAcertitude\n9,682 followers\n9,682 followers\nThe 2026 Global Cybersecurity Outlook highlights an important dynamic shaping cyber risk management today: a widening divergence between how CEOs and CISOs perceive risk.\nChief executives are increasingly focused on cyber-enabled fraud, AI-driven vulnerabilities, and financial impact. Security leaders, by contrast, continue to prioritize ransomware and supply chain resilience. Both perspectives are valid, but when they are not aligned, investment decisions and accountability can become fragmented.\nOrganizations with strong cyber resilience tend to close this gap through leadership. They rely on cyber executives who can operate credibly in the boardroom, translate technical risk into commercial terms, and align security strategy with business priorities.\nThis is the lens our Cyber practice, led by Partner Tim C",
